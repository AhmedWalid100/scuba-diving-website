# Project Description

In this project, you can add sections to the HTML and it will be added automatically to the menu. The menu will be fully-functional without doing any extra work, because it's coded to be dynamic via JavaScript.
You can jump to the desired section by the navigation menu. 
The section in your viewport will be highlighted, and its related nav-menu element will be highlighted too.

## Usage

This is an interactive landing page. If you want to add content, you can add it easily without worrying about the menu and other functions, because JavaScript takes care of all that.
